- share a milestone with another user of his choice

### **Requirements**

- H2 Database
- Java SDK 11.0.3 (64-bit)

### **Support**

In case you find any bug, or issue in our codes, please create a pull request. We will be happy to chat more and apply the feedback.

### **Roadmap**

This is the first phase of our application. In the near future, we are planning to include more features especially security related. We take care of our users information; thus, their data privacy and confidentiality are our number one priority.  Now, a user can login using his email and any password either be strong or not. However, in the second phase, we want to make it a requirement for a user to create strong password. Next, we need to include also a two-factor authentication option using SMS or call.

### **Authors and acknowledgment**

This application was built by a team of three ALC Students: Faouzi Jedidi, Yonas Chapi, and Heritier Muhire.
